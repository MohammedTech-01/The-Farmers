# Plant Health Monitoring System

This repository contains Python scripts for monitoring plant health using drone technology and alert notifications for disease detection.

## Files Description

1. **alert.txt**: A text file containing alert notifications for plant disease detection.
2. **main.py**: The main Python script that orchestrates the detection of plant diseases.
3. **With_drone.py**: A Python script for simulating drone-assisted monitoring of plant health.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. The scripts may require additional libraries, which should be installed manually as needed.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Plant-Health-Monitoring-System.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd Plant-Health-Monitoring-System
   ```

### Running the Scripts

#### Main Script
Execute the following command in your terminal to run the main monitoring script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

#### Drone Simulation
To simulate drone-assisted monitoring, run the following script:
   ```bash
   python With_drone.py
   ```

### Viewing Alerts
Check the `alert.txt` file for notifications about plant health issues detected by the system. For example:
   ```text
   Alert: Disease detected at Row 2, Column 2
   ```

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the scripts or the alert system are welcome. Please read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines on how to make a contribution.
