# Soil Health Monitoring System

This repository contains Python scripts for a system designed to monitor soil health using a car-based sensor platform, and alert files that provide notifications on soil checks.

## Files Description

1. **alert.txt**: A text file containing notifications for soil checks.
2. **Car.py**: A Python script that simulates a car equipped with sensors checking soil health.
3. **main.py**: The main Python script that orchestrates the soil monitoring operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. Additional libraries required by the scripts should be installed as needed.

### Running the Scripts

#### Main Script
Execute the following command in your terminal to run the main soil monitoring script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

#### Car Simulation
To simulate the soil checking process using the car:
   ```bash
   python Car.py
   ```

### Viewing Alerts
Open the `alert.txt` file to see notifications about soil checks. For example:
   ```text
   The soil at Row 5, Column 5 has been checked!
   ```

## Contributing
