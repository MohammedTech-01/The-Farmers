# AgriHealth

## Introduction
AgriHealth is an integrated AI solution aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity through advanced detection of plant diseases and continuous monitoring of soil health. By leveraging the power of drones, IoT devices, and machine learning models, this platform enables farmers to make informed decisions that lead to higher crop yields and lower costs.

## Features
- **Disease Detection**: Utilizes computer vision and machine learning to identify plant diseases early, helping prevent their spread.
- **Soil Monitoring**: Provides insights on moisture and nutrient levels, ensuring optimal conditions for crop growth.
- **IoT Integration**: Combines aerial images from drones and soil data from IoT-enabled cars for comprehensive field management.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- PyTorch
- Streamlit
- MobileNetV3, ResNet18, AlexNet (for model training)
